# Github-Readme-Generator
This application will generate a README.md file after receiving user inputs and create table of contents accordingly.
This is the first project that I have created using node.js.  
Axios was used to get an API response from the github API to receive the users repo's, profile picture and email address.  
Inquirer was used to ask the user a series of questions to populate the README.md file.
